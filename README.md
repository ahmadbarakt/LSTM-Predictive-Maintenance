# Introduction:
Maintenance management is an important part of well-functioning production and becomes very crucial for companies that carry critical operations such as hospital, electric utilities, etc. Thus, preventive and predicative maintenance play huge role in preventing emergency shut downs

# About This Project:
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a neural networks expert system powered by deep learning. The deep learning model will use LSTM arcitucture to detect if a an equipemtn is close to failure. This will support the maintenance planning of critical assets and equipments, by using data mining and statistical models to determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to estimate when maintenance should be performed.

# Dataset:
The data was collected from convyours sensors in a high storage system to transport one package between two spots. The data was released by Smartfactory and publicly avaialble on [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/nafisur/dataset-for-predictive-maintenance)
